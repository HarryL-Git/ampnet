# Attention as Message Passing (ampnet)
Graph Neural Network architecture utilizing Multi-head attention during message passing
steps.


## Quickstart:
1. Create an Anaconda environment with Python 3.7
2. Install Pytorch 1.9.0 through anaconda
3. Install PyTorch Geometric with the command:
    ```conda install -c pyg pyg```
4. Uninstall torch-spline-conv:
    ```pip uninstall torch-spline-conv```
5. Run experiments/cora_benchmark_graphsaint.py 


Current development is mostly occurring in experiments/cora_benchmark_graphsaint.py.
